/// 27.0.6 on 2026-09-07 it found **40 recipients execute and 45 exceed the
/// budget** (`Error(Budget, ExceededLimit)`). An initial guess of 100 was
/// wrong by more than a factor of two, which is the argument for measuring.
///
/// `max_recipients_is_within_what_actually_executes` re-measures on every CI
/// run and fails if this constant drifts above what the code can actually do,

/// # It is still not the on-chain ceiling

/// The local test environment models the CPU/memory budget but **not** the
/// transaction size limit a real network applies to the submitted envelope,
/// and its `mock_all_auths` builds a separate authorization entry per transfer
/// where a real submission signs one tree. The real figure could be higher or
/// lower. Re-run the ramp against testnet before `v0.2` and set this from that
/// measurement.

/// exhausts the ledger budget is an outage.

//
// `#[contractimpl]` reads argument types syntactically and cannot resolve an
// alias, so it emitted a contract spec referring to a user-defined type called
// `Payments` that does not exist. The contract deployed and the Rust tests all
// passed, but every client reading the spec broke: `stellar contract invoke`
// failed with `Missing Entry Payments` on *any* function of the contract,
// including argument-less ones, because the whole interface failed to load.
//
// Spell soroban types out in full in entry-point signatures.
